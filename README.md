## Organization: CNCF (TUF Project)

As a Google Summer of Code 2022 mentee, I worked on the [TUF project](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf) under my mentors [Marina Moore](https://github.com/mnm678) and [Zach Newman](https://github.com/znewman01) (co-advising) to implement [TAP 14](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap14.md). This included implementing version management for TUF‚Äôs python reference implementation. The implementation does not currently have a way to migrate TUF repositories or clients to a new TUF version that has breaking changes. This project will be the implementation of a proposal for coordinating specification versions between a repository and a client to prevent interruptions in access to updates after a major version change to the specification.

## Goals achieved

- Setting up sample test files for future tests 
- Add tests to check for the test files
- Add the functionality to get the list of specification versions supported by the repository
- Add the functionality to choose the highest matching version between the repository and the client
- Add tests for checking the functionality to get the highest matching version
- Worked on implementing further changes through the review process

## Work remaining

- Adding tests to check the functionality of getting specification versions supported by the repository
- Working on the special cases

## Current State

The current state of the project allows the client to choose and select the highest supported version between both the repository and the client. It also allows in choosing the versions supported by the repository. This introduces backwards compatibility. Tests to check the the functionality are also provided.

## TAP 14 draft pr

https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/pull/2049.
This pr has been superseded by: https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/pull/2114

## Challenges and Learnings

I had to learn on the go. This meant learning about the different python libraries and implementing them as I learnt about them. This helped me in broadening my python knowledge. I also got to know and apply what I learnt about Git&Github. I came to appreciate how great a tool Git is in source code management.

## Summary
Had a lot of fun working on implementing changes and learning a lot in the process. Also loved working with and learning from great mentors who had a lot of knowledge to impart. üëç
